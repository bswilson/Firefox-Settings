# Firefox-Settings

This repository hosts free, shareable instructions on how to make Firefox more private and secure. Indeed, you can get a lot of “mileage” out of modifying Firefox's default settings to improve both privacy and security.

This documentation will detail how to:

Disable sponsored shortcuts, search suggestions, set Enhanced Tracking Protection to “strict”, enable “Do Not Track”, enable Global Privacy Control, clear cookies when exiting Firefox, disable Firefox Suggest, turn off Location/Camera/Microphone permissions, block pop-up windows, disable all Firefox Data Collection and Use, enable all Deceptive Content and Dangerous Software Protection checkboxes, enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows, enable DNS over HTTPS (max protection), sign out and do not use Sync.

Change your search engine from Google to a more secure option (DuckDuckGo, Startpage, Ecosia, Brave Search, etc.)

Use privacy- and security-related Extensions like tools for blocking ads and trackers (uBlock Origin, Ghostery, Privacy Badger, Facebook Container, etc.) 

Advanced settings – Disabling components via about:config, settings portable preferences via user.js, decoupling Pocket from the browser, etc.
