# Firefox-Settings

This documentation repository hosts free, shareable instructions on how to modify Firefox to make it more private and secure. Indeed, you can get a lot of “mileage” out of modifying Firefox's default settings to improve both privacy and security. These documents will detail what to change within Firefox, and will also address some of the most helpful extensions and related security settings, such as DNS and content filtering. 

## Why should you take my advice?

Read [more about me](https://bscottwilson.com/) if you like. I've been around awhile and have been securing web browsers since Mosaic, Netscape Navigator, Firebird, and Firefox 1.0. 

## What's included

This documentation will be provided in multiple parts.

### Part 1 - Security and Privacy Settings

Set Enhanced Tracking Protection to “strict”, enable “Do Not Track”, enable [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/), clear cookies when exiting Firefox, turn off Location/Camera/Microphone permissions, block pop-up windows, enable all Deceptive Content and Dangerous Software Protection checkboxes, enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows, enable DNS over HTTPS (max protection), sign out and do not use Sync.

### Part 2 - Telemetry and Search

Disable sponsored shortcuts and search suggestions. Change your search engine from Google to a more secure option (DuckDuckGo, Startpage, Ecosia, Brave Search, etc.). Disable Firefox Suggest, and disable all Firefox Data Collection and Use. 

### Part 3 - Extensions

Use privacy and security-related browser extensions, like tools for blocking ads and trackers (uBlock Origin, Ghostery, Privacy Badger, Facebook Container, etc.)

### Part 4 - Advanced Settings

Disabling components via about:config, setting portable preferences via user.js, decoupling Pocket from the browser, etc.
